pushd and popd commands are a means of fast and efficient bookmarking of directories.
with cd you usually navigate through directories, but you have to remember the paths and they can be quite long. 
You use pushd like cd to move into a directory, e.g. $ pushd <directory-path>
Additionally to moving into the directory, the path of it is added on top of the stack. Think of the stack as a stack of papers.
pushd notes the directory on a new paper und puts it on top of the stack. 
popd takes the first paper from the top of that stack, reads it and moves to that directoy. 
You can access any index in that stack by adding +number to it, e.g. pushd +2 adds a paper 2 sheets down from the top.
popd +10 removes the tenth sheet in the stack counted from the top. You can also count from the bottom by using -x
